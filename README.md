# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe is a simple two-player game played on a 3×3 grid. Players take turns marking a cell with either X or O. The first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw. It’s a quick, strategic game that encourages logical thinking.
